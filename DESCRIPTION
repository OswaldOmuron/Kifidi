Description: 
    Kifidi is optimized for handling complex datasets commonly used in 
    environmental and ecological research, offering functionality that 
    isn't fully met by general-purpose packages. It provides only two key 
    functions, 'summarize_data()' for summarizing datasets and 'plot_means()' 
    for plotting with error bars, ensuring ease of use for researchers. 
    The 'plot_means()' function incorporates error bars by default, 
    allowing for quick visualization of uncertainties crucial in ecological 
    studies. Kifidi streamlines the workflow for grouped datasets (e.g., by 
    species or treatment), making it particularly user-friendly and reducing 
    the complexity and time required for summarizing and visualizing data.
